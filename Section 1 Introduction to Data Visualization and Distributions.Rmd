##1.1 Introduction to Data Visualization

Categorical data are variables that are defined by a small number of groups.
  Ordinal categorical data have an inherent order to the categories (mild/medium/hot, for example).
  Non-ordinal categorical data have no order to the categories.
Numerical data take a variety of numeric values.
  Continuous variables can take any value.
  Discrete variables are limited to sets of specific values.

For categorical data we can construct this distribution by simply computing the frequency of each unique value. This can be done with the function *table*

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
x <- heights$height
head(table(x))
```

  
##1.2 Introduction to Distributions


```{r}
# load the dataset
library(dslabs)
data(heights)

# make a table of category proportions
prop.table(table(heights$sex))  
```
